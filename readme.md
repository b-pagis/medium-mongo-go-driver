# Purpose
To see how much hassle it would take to have 100% coverage, including some bits that belongs external library.

# Disclaimer
This repository was used for learning purposes **only**. It does not contain good practices nor it should be used as a template for your next project. 

If you are following this as an example for writing unit tests for database implementation, I would **strongly advice to** stop and **invest your time writing integration tests instead**.


# As of 2020
This is an old learning project that was copy / pasted from even older one (2017) that used mgo drivers. Official drivers introduced some new things, so I wanted to learn and play with it. This project is messy and written in some incorrect fashion. 
As last touch for 2020, I have added user2020 handlers with tests, as an example to throw away the middleware part, as side effect of overengineer.

Rest remains untouched (RIP).
